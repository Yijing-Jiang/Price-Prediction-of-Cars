# Price-Prediction-of-Cars
Thanks to the dataset from kaggle/missing-cars

**Abstract:**

This report is to solve the regression problem of price prediction of cars on some related features and compare the performance of different models. 

Use the constant model as a baseline and also use linear regression models , such as **MLE**, **Ridge** and **Lasso regression**, and nonlinear regression models, such as **KNN**, **CART**, **Random Forest** and **Boosting**. 

Nonlinear regression models perform better than linear regression models. **Gradient boosting regressio**n has the best performance of RMSE on the test dataset equal to **1236.16**. 

Also find the importance of features with the price of cars.
